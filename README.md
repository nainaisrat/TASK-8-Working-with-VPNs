# Task 8:  Working with VPNs

## Objective
Set up ProtonVPN free tier to understand VPN privacy protection and performance impact.

## Steps Performed
1. Connected to Netherlands server (NL-FREE#146)
2. Verified IP change:
   - Original: `123.253.98.163` (Bangladesh)
   - VPN: `169.150.218.89` (Netherlands)
3. Confirmed traffic encryption
4. Analyzed speed impact (~50% reduction)

## Key Findings
✅ **Benefits**:
- IP successfully masked
- Traffic encrypted via WireGuard
- ISP tracking prevented

⚠️ **Limitations**:
- 91% server load (free tier)
- Significant speed reduction
- Datacenter IP easily detectable
